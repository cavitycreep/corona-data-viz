Find the per capita rate of infection in the county for the last two weeks

Take this week's data and find its median, call it value c

    [1, 1, 0, 2, 5, 0, 3] =~ [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5], c = 1

Take last week's data and find its median, call it value l

    [5, 7, 3, 4, 0, 2, 1] =~ [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7], l = 3

From those, subtract l from c and chart it

    c - l = 1 - 3 = -2 = rr

Value rr is this week's rate of infection compared to last week's
